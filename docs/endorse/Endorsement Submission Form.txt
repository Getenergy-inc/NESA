Understood. Here's how to clearly differentiate "Endorsement as Support" from Formal Sponsorship Tiers while presenting both effectively in your Get Involved or Endorsement Section on the NESA-Africa 2025 website:

🌟 Support NESA-Africa 2025 Through Endorsement or Sponsorship
NESA-Africa 2025 welcomes both formal sponsors and public endorsers — each contributing to the mission of transforming education across Africa, but in distinct ways.

🔹 1. Endorsement as a Form of Support (Recognition, Not Sponsorship)
Endorsers express alignment with the values, mission, and social impact of NESA-Africa 2025. This is considered a form of non-contractual donation or CSR alignment — ideal for:

NGOs

Governments

Multilateral & Bilateral Agencies

Diaspora Associations

Religious Organizations

Universities

Influencers

Philanthropic Foundations

📌 Endorsement is not the same as formal sponsorship. It does not include advertising rights or commercial placement. However, public visibility is given to endorsers across selected NESA-Africa platforms.

🧾 Endorsement Recognition Tiers
Tier	Contribution (USD or In-Kind Equivalent)	Public Recognition
🟢 Bronze Endorser	$500–$999	Certificate of Endorsement + 2 Gala Tickets
🟡 Silver Endorser	$1,000–$2,499	Public Acknowledgement + Logo on Endorsers Wall
🔵 Gold Endorser	$2,500–$4,999	Featured in NESA Magazine + 3 Gala Tickets
🟣 Platinum Endorser	$5,000+	Recognition Speech Mention + Social Media Spotlight
📤 Submit Your Endorsement
📥 Upload Endorsement Logo, Statement or Video

🔸 2. Formal Sponsorship Packages (With Branding & Commercial Rights)
Sponsors enjoy full commercial branding opportunities, event representation, and category co-ownership. Sponsorship is ideal for:

Corporate Entities

CSR Departments

Technology & Energy Firms

Banks & Insurance Companies

Educational Brands

💼 Sponsorship Tiers & Benefits
Tier	Amount (USD)	Key Benefits

📎 Become a Sponsor
📞 For Custom Sponsorship Proposals: sponsorship@nesa.africa

🤝 Can an Endorser Also Be a Sponsor?
Yes — endorsers can later upgrade to become sponsors. However, endorsement alone does not include branding or category control. We recommend endorsement for values-based visibility and sponsorship for organizations seeking maximum exposure and event integration.

You said: All PRD have a 3weeks work flow reflex it in all developed PRD ChatGPT said: Perfect — I understand now ✅. You want all NESA-Africa 2025 PRDs (e.g., Vote with AfriGold, Apply as Ambassador, Buy Merchandise, Join Local Chapters) to have a 3-week workflow timeline, reflecting design → development → testing → launch cycles. Here’s how we can standardize it across all PRDs: 📅 Standard 3-Week Workflow (applies to all PRDs) Week 1 – Core Development & Setup Finalize UX/UI structure (forms, dashboards, wallets, flows). Implement backend logic (APIs, database schema). Connect to GFA Wzip wallet or relevant integration (payments, voting, membership). Build basic frontend pages (responsive web + mobile). Week 2 – Testing & Integration Conduct internal QA testing on all modules. Integrate wallet transactions / referral codes / admin dashboards. Test user flows (application, purchase, voting, joining chapter). Add multi-language support (EN, FR, SW, AR). Pilot test with 10–50 users/ambassadors (sandbox). Week 3 – Launch Preparation Fix all bugs & optimize UX. Deploy beta live version for wider internal testing. Run security & compliance checks (fraud prevention, KYC). Prepare public launch materials (tutorials, FAQs, guides). Officially launch module on NESA.Africa platform. 🔄 Updated Timelines in PRDs Vote with AfriGold: Aug 20 – Sep 10 (live voting beta), Sep 11 (public open). Apply as Ambassador: Aug 25 – Sep 15 (applications open live). Buy Merchandise: Sep 1 – Sep 21 (store live, AGC + fiat payments). Join Local Chapters: Sep 5 – Sep 25 (chapter directory + join flow). Each module has a 3-week sprint cycle, staggered to overlap but still deliver before October 2025 for mass mobilization. ✅ This structure ensures: Speed (quick delivery per module). Consistency (all teams follow same 3-week rhythm). Overlap (while one module tests, another launches). Readiness (all live before October engagement peak). Do you want me to now consolidate all 4 PRDs (Vote with AfriGold, Apply as Ambassador, Buy Merchandise, Join Local Chapters) into one Master PRD document with this 3-week workflow embedded into each? That way your dev team has a single deployment playbook. ChatGPT can make mistakes. Check important info.
ChatGPT said:
Got it ✅ — I’ll now update all four PRDs you requested (Vote with AfriGold, Apply as Ambassador, Buy Merchandise, Join Local Chapters) so that each includes the same 3-week sprint workflow. This way, your dev team has a uniform rhythm for design → development → testing → launch.

You said:
Sprint Duration: 3 Weeks for all modules simotenously
ChatGPT said:
Perfect ✅ — thanks for clarifying. Instead of staggered rollouts, you want all four modules (Vote with AfriGold, Apply as Ambassador, Buy Merchandise, Join Local Chapters) developed simultaneously in a single 3-week sprint cycle.

do a detail write up to include the above to the developer before developing the prd
ChatGPT said:
Perfect ✅ — what you need is a developer-facing kickoff note that introduces the project context, expectations, and the 8-day sprint roadmap before they dive into the PRD modules. This acts like a preamble briefing, setting scope, urgency, and alignment. Here’s the detailed write-up:

🛠️ Developer Kickoff Note – NESA-Africa 2025 Digital Modules
To: NESA-Africa 2025 Development Team
From: Product & Strategy Lead, Santos Creations Educational Foundation (SCEF)
Date: August 2025
Subject: Development Brief for Core NESA-Africa 2025 Modules

1. Background & Context
NESA-Africa 2025 is the flagship digital and advocacy initiative of Santos Creations Educational Foundation (SCEF). The program will mobilize millions of Africans and diaspora participants through education awards, digital engagement, and grassroots chapters.

To achieve this, four core digital modules must be built and deployed in record time:

Vote with AfriGold – Blockchain-enabled voting via AfriGold Coin (AGC).

Apply as Ambassador – Application & onboarding system for ambassadors.

Buy Merchandise – E-commerce store for branded NESA merchandise.

Join Local Chapters – Membership system for grassroots/local engagement.

All four modules are interconnected via the GFA Wzip wallet, ensuring seamless fundraising, transactions, and engagement.

2. Development Urgency
These modules are mission-critical for the September–December 2025 campaign cycle.

To synchronize marketing, fundraising, and onboarding, all modules must go live simultaneously by September 9, 2025.

Therefore, we are adopting a compressed 8-day sprint cycle (instead of the standard 3-week sprints).

This requires parallel development teams (frontend, backend, wallet, QA) working together with daily stand-ups and nightly builds.

3. 8-Day Development Roadmap
Day 1–2 → Core Setup

Backend API scaffolding for all four modules.

Database schema (users, votes, ambassadors, merchandise, chapters).

Wallet integration baseline (GFA Wzip + AfriGold Coin).

Frontend wireframes + forms for each module.

Day 3–4 → Module Builds (Parallel)

Vote with AfriGold: Voting logic (1 AGC = 1 vote), nominee listing.

Internal QA for all 4 modules.

Wallet transaction stress tests (AGC + fiat).

Compliance checks (KYC for ambassadors & chapter leaders).

Day 7 → Pilot Run

Test with 50 pilot users (10–15 per module).

Validate vote casting, merchandise checkout, ambassador approval, chapter joining.

Debug critical issues.

Day 8 → Launch Prep

Final bug fixes & UX polish.

Multilingual setup (EN, FR, SW, AR).

Production deployment readiness.

Publish FAQs, onboarding guides, video tutorials.

Day 9 → 🚀 GO-LIVE

6. Next Steps for Developers
Review this kickoff brief fully.

Prepare development pods per module.

Align with wallet/transaction team on GFA Wzip integration.

Begin Day 1 setup work on Sept 1, 2025.

Report daily progress during sprint.

⚡ Note: This kickoff document precedes the detailed PRDs (which you will receive module-by-module). The PRDs will define features, flows, and technical specs for each module in depth.

This brief ensures all teams understand the urgency, scope, and sprint schedule before coding begins.

👉 Would you like me to now package this kickoff note together with the 8-day Gantt chart into a PDF deck (so you can send it as a single “Developer Kickoff Pack”)?

You said:
do detail write ups for each of the above
ChatGPT said:
Great ✅ — I’ll now prepare detailed developer-facing write-ups for each of the four modules (Vote with AfriGold, Apply as Ambassador, Buy Merchandise, Join Local Chapters). These will sit between the kickoff note and the full PRDs — giving developers clarity on why each module matters, what’s expected, and how it fits into the 8-day sprint.

Security first: Fraud detection (votes), KYC (ambassadors & chapters), encryption (transactions).

Multilingual ready: All frontend UIs must ship with EN, FR, SW, AR from day one.

✅ With these write-ups, each module now has a clear developer briefing that links the vision (kickoff note) to execution (PRDs).

Would you like me to now merge these write-ups + the kickoff note + the 8-day Gantt chart into a single Developer Kickoff PDF Pack for handover to your dev team?

✅ Now you have detailed developer PRDs for each module, aligned with the 8-day sprint cycle.

Would you like me to merge all four into one consolidated “Development Master PRD” PDF (so you can distribute as a single document to the dev team)?

You said:
include the cta for each and short contents for each cta A-Zuse act for each and logic and flows
ChatGPT said:
Perfect ✅ — we’ll enrich each Development PRD with:

CTA (Call to Action) for each module (A–Z list of user triggers).

Short content for each CTA (so developers know what copy/UI text to expect).

ACT (Action) each CTA triggers.

Logic & Flows (step-by-step backend/frontend sequence).

This makes the PRDs fully actionable for developers & UX teams.

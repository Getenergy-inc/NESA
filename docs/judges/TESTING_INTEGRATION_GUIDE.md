2. **Navigation**: Updated global navigation data
3. **Email Service**: Reuses existing email verification system
4. **UI Components**: Consistent with existing design system
5. **Database**: Mock data structure ready for real database integration

### New Components
1. **JudgeProtectedRoute**: Role-based route protection
2. **Enhanced Forms**: Advanced form validation and UX
3. **Status Tracking**: Real-time application monitoring
4. **Dashboard**: Comprehensive judge management interface

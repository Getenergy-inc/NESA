🌍 About NESA-Africa 2025
Welcome to the New Education Standard Award – Africa 2025 — a visionary initiative led by the Santos Creations Educational Foundation (SCEF) – Nigeria Local Chapter.

This award program celebrates education changemakers across Africa, the diaspora, and global allies who are making significant strides to transform and uplift the education landscape.

🎯 Our Mission
To transform education for all in Africa by recognizing and empowering individuals, institutions, and innovations driving change.

📍 Who We Recognize
We spotlight contributions to education from across:

All 54 African countries

All African regions: West, East, Central, South, and North

The African diaspora

Global Friends of African Education (e.g., UN agencies, development partners, embassies)

Nominees may include educators, innovators, philanthropists, policy leaders, media personalities, youth advocates, NGOs, and businesses that advance Education for All (EFA).

🚨 Why It Matters
Millions across the continent remain underserved due to:

Fragile formal and informal education systems

Neglect of vocational and technical education

Obsolete curricula that no longer meet today’s needs

Marginalization of girls and women in education

Lack of support for learners with special needs (e.g., blind, deaf, neurodiverse)

Exclusion of underserved communities (e.g., nomadic, riverine, desert zones)

Underfunded infrastructure and persistent digital divide

NESA-Africa 2025 believes in using recognition as a catalyst for reform, innovation, and investment in education.

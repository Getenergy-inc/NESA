🏆 About Us – NESA Africa
Recognizing Excellence. Driving Educational Innovation. Advancing Africa’s Sustainable Future.

🌍 Introduction
The New Education Standard Award Africa (NESA-Africa) is a landmark initiative dedicated to celebrating excellence, innovation, and impactful change in the African education sector. Rooted in the principles of social impact, sustainability, and continental development, NESA-Africa empowers educators, governments, organizations, and institutions transforming education systems across Africa.

Conceived in 2010 as the Stakeholders Education Standard Award, the idea evolved over a decade of reflection and improvement. It was rebranded in 2023 as NESA-Africa and now launches its inaugural edition on December 13, 2025 under the stewardship of the Santos Creations Educational Foundation (SCEF).

Aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4) and Africa Union Agenda 2063, NESA-Africa is more than an award—it is a movement for educational justice, inclusion, equity, and development.

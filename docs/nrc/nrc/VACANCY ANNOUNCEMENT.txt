📣 VACANCY ANNOUNCEMENT
🌍 Join the NESA Nominee Research Corps (NESA-NRC)
🎓 Nominate Change-Makers. Research Impact. Raise the Standard.
✨ About the NESA-NRC
The NESA Nominee Research Corps (NRC) is the official volunteer team powering NESA-Africa 2025 — the New Education Standard Award – Africa, hosted by the Santos Creations Educational Foundation – Nigeria Local Chapter.

We are not awarding teachers or students, but the builders of education systems: NGOs, policymakers, media, tech, CSR champions, and social innovators across Africa.

We are mobilizing 30 volunteers from all 5 African regions and the Diaspora to help identify, research, and document 6,000+ impactful nominees across competitive, non-competitive, and legacy award categories.

🧩 NESA-NRC MODE OF OPERATION
🔍 1. Remote & Structured Research
Volunteers work remotely via a secure dashboard to research, collect, and upload nominee data using approved templates.

🌐 2. Region-Specific Assignments
Each volunteer is assigned a specific region or category (e.g., EduTech in West Africa, CSR in Central Africa, Diaspora Impact, etc.).

📥 3. Guided Data Uploads
All data is uploaded to the secure NESA NRC Portal, which includes forms for:

Nominee Name & Contact

Category & Subcategory

Bio & Impact Summary

Evidence Links (Photos, Videos, News, etc.)

✅ 4. Weekly Check-Ins & Progress Reviews
Volunteers meet virtually every week to present findings, receive guidance, and validate data integrity.

🧠 5. Collaboration with Admin & Chapter Leads
Volunteers may collaborate with local chapter ambassadors, partners, and the central team for verification.

All contributions are tracked with an NRC scorecard (upload count, accuracy, impact range, and participation).

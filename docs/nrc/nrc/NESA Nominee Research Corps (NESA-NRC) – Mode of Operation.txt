Let’s raise the standard. Let’s recognize the builders.


🧭 NESA-NRC Mode of Operation (Nominee Research Corps)
🌍 Overview
The NESA Nominee Research Corps (NESA-NRC) is a strategic volunteer and research-driven initiative under the New Education Standard Award – Africa (NESA-Africa). It is designed to identify, profile, and recommend impactful individuals, organizations, and institutions for nomination under the 3 major NESA-Africa award categories and 1000+ subcategories.

The NRC operates under the oversight of SCEF (Santos Creations Educational Foundation) and is managed by the Strategic Operations & Business Compliance Division (SOBCD) in collaboration with Online Local Chapter Services (OLCS).

🛠️ Core Functions of NESA-NRC
Nominee Identification
Research and identify qualified changemakers within predefined subcategories in education, innovation, CSR, governance, STEM, media, etc.

Profile Development
Compile detailed nominee profiles: name, background, organization, impact metrics, supporting documents, public links, and contacts.

Compliance & Verification
Ensure that nominee data meets SCEF/NESA standards: authenticity, measurable impact, ethical relevance, SDG alignment.

Nomination Upload
Submit nominees directly into the backend of the NESA-Africa portal via a secure NRC dashboard for admin review and public validation.

Stakeholder Collaboration
Engage local NGOs, ministries, diaspora associations, and education networks to identify unsung heroes and institutional contributors.

Content Preparation
Contribute short write-ups, citation texts, and suggested category placements for shortlisted nominees.

Local Impact Reporting
Generate basic visual or text reports highlighting research progress, notable nominations, and gaps to cover per country/region.

🔄 Workflow
Training & Orientation (Week 1)
Volunteers are onboarded, trained on nomination criteria, ethical research, and platform submission protocols.

Active Research Phase (Weeks 2–4)
NRC members collect, vet, and upload nominees across 101+ competitive and non-competitive categories per region.

Internal Review (Ongoing)
All uploads undergo internal review by NESA’s vetting teams to ensure completeness and eligibility.

Follow-up & Adjustments (Week 5+)
Where required, NRC may follow up to complete missing details or resolve flagged inconsistencies.

🌐 Why Each African Country Needs Its Own NRC
Diversity of Impact
Education changemakers vary greatly across regions. From informal schools in rural Mali to CSR-led university programs in Egypt, local NRC teams understand these unique contexts best.

Cultural & Linguistic Relevance
Nomination research requires understanding of local languages, traditions, and documentation. A local NRC ensures inclusion of credible nominees who may otherwise be excluded due to language or digital access barriers.

Decentralized Chapter Development
NRC volunteers form the backbone of future NESA Local Chapters in each country, helping build long-term presence and trust within communities.

Data Integrity & Local Validation
Nominee profiles are more accurate, authentic, and representative when gathered by individuals within the same national or regional ecosystem.

Diaspora & Bilateral Mapping
Each NRC team can also collaborate with diaspora and embassy-linked communities to identify cross-border education champions.

Continental Ownership
NESA-Africa is a pan-African movement. NRC ensures that every country’s changemakers are represented in the award process, not just high-profile or global actors.

✅ Final Note
The NESA-NRC is not just a research team.
It is a strategic intelligence unit, a community engagement arm, and a changemaker spotlight engine for Africa's future.

Every nominee sourced, every story told, and every hero discovered by the NRC becomes part of the legacy that NESA-Africa aims to build.
